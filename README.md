## About
Delivery Driver is a top-down 2D driving game. The player navigates the map to collect packages, which change the color of the vehicle once collected and once again when the package has been delivered to the destination. Players are also able to drive over speed boosts and bumps which modify the speed of the car accordingly.

This game development project focused on the basic fundamentals of C#, including:
- variables
- if statements
- methods
- triggers
- colliders
- references

This project also served as an introduction to the use of the unity game engine.
